# Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)

## 📖 Project Overview
Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) is a **Java SE console-based application** that helps institutes manage:
- 👩‍🎓 Students (create/update, enroll/unenroll, transcripts)
- 📘 Courses (create/update, search, assign instructors)
- 📝 Enrollments & Grades (record marks, compute GPA, generate transcripts)
- 📂 File Utilities (import/export CSV, recursive backups, reports)

It demonstrates **Java OOP, NIO.2 file I/O, Streams, Date/Time API, exceptions, enums, design patterns (Singleton, Builder)**, and more.

📜 Evolution of Java (Brief Timeline)

1995: Java 1.0 released by Sun Microsystems
2004: Java 5.0 introduced Generics, Enums

Java ME vs SE vs EE

Edition	:  Usage
Java ME :  Mobile & embedded devices
Java SE	:  Core platform for desktop & CLI apps
Java EE	: Enterprise apps (web servers distributed systems)



🔷JDK, JRE, JVM

JDK – Developer kit (compiler, debugger, libraries)
JRE – Runtime environment (to run Java apps)
JVM – Virtual machine that executes bytecode

Interaction:
Source Code (.java) → compiled by javac → Bytecode (.class) → runs on JVM inside JRE.


🖥️ Install Java on Windows

Download JDK from Oracle/OpenJDK
Install & set JAVA_HOME in Environment Variables

Verify:
java -version
javac -version


Eclipse IDE Setup

Install Eclipse IDE
File → New → Java Project → CCRM
Import src/ folder
Right-click CLIApp.java → Run As → Java Application

## 📂 Data & Test Files

The data/ folder contains initial CSV files which serve as *test data* for the Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM):

- data/students.csv → initial student records  
- data/courses.csv → initial course records  
- data/enrollments.csv → initial enrollment records

When the program runs:  
- It reads data from these files to populate the system.  
- Exported data is saved in the exports/ folder.  
- Backups are created in timestamped folders inside the backups/ folder.
